# Donut

This python script is capable of generating a .mp4 video of a spinning donut.
This idea was originally brought to life in the C programming language, by Andy Sloane.
You can go check his website to see the math behind the donut.c code :

## Usage

Before executing the script, take a look at the code and modify the variables describing the characteristics of the video (frame dimensions, donut size, etc) to match your needs. Some variable names are directly taken from Andy Sloane's website, so go check it out to fully understand the code.

Be sure to run

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

before executing the script with :

```
python3 donut.py
```

## Performance

Please note that in order to keep the script easy to read, it is not quite optimized for performance yet.
